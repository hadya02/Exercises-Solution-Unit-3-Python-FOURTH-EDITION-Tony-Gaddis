Areas of Rectangles
The area of a rectangle is the rectangle’s length times its width. Write a program that asks
for the length and width of two rectangles. The program should tell the user which rectangle has the greater area, or if the areas are the same.


l_1=int(input("first rectangle's lenght:"))
w_1=int(input("first rectangle's width:"))
l_2=int(input("second rectangle's lenght: "))
w_2=int(input("second rectangle's width: "))
area_r1=l_1*w_1
print("rectangle_1 area=",area_r1)
area_2=l_2*w_2
print("rectangle_2 area=",area_2)
if area_r1>area_2:
    print("the first rectangle has greater area")
elif area_r1<area_2:
    print("the second rectangle has greater area")
elif area_r1==area_2:
    print("rectangle_1 = rectangle_2 ")
