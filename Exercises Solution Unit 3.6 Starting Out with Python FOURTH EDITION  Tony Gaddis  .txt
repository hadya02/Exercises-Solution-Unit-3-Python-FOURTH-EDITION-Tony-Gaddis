Magic Dates
The date June 10, 1960, is special because when it is written in the following format, the
month times the day equals the year:
6/10/60
Design a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a twodigit year. The program should then determine whether the month times the day equals the
year. If so, it should display a message saying the date is magic. Otherwise, it should display
a message saying the date is not magic.



month=int(input("enter the month in numeric form"))
day=int(input("enter the day in numeric form"))
year=int(input("enter the year in numeric form, in two_digit"))
if month*day==year:
    print("the date is majic.")
else:
    print("the date is not magic.")
