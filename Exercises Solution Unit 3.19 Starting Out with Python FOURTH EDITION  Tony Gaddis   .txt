Wi-Fi Diagnostic Tree
Figure 3-19 shows a simplified flowchart for troubleshooting a bad Wi-Fi connection. Use
the flowchart to create a program that leads a person through the steps of fixing a bad
Wi-Fi connection. Here is an example of the program’s output:
Reboot the computer and try to connect.
Did that fix the problem? no Enter
Reboot the router and try to connect.
Did that fix the problem? yes Enter
Notice the program ends as soon as a solution is found to the problem. Here is another
example of the program’s output:
Reboot the computer and try to connect.
Did that fix the problem? no Enter
Reboot the router and try to connect.
Did that fix the problem? no Enter
Make sure the cables between the router and modem are plugged in firmly.
Did that fix the problem? no Enter
Move the router to a new location.
Did that fix the problem? no Enter
Get a new router.
