 Software Sales
A software company sells a package that retails for $99. Quantity discounts are given
according to the following table:
Quantity Discount
10–19 10%
20–49 20%
50–99 30%
100 or more 40%
Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of packages purchased. The program should then display the amount of the discount (if any) and the total amount of the
purchase after the discount.


num_package_purchased=int(input("number of package of purchased:"))
if num_package_purchased>=10 and num_package_purchased<=19:
    print("discount:10%")
elif num_package_purchased>=20 and num_package_purchased<=49:
     print("discount:20%")   
elif num_package_purchased>=50 and num_package_purchased<=99:
     print("discount:30%")
elif num_package_purchased>=100:
     print("discount:40%")
