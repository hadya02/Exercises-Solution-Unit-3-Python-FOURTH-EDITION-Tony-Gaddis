Restaurant Selector
You have a group of friends coming to visit for your high school reunion, and you want
to take them out to eat at a local restaurant. You aren’t sure if any of them have dietary
restrictions, but your restaurant choices are as follows:
Joe’s Gourmet Burgers—Vegetarian: No, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: No
Main Street Pizza Company—Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: Yes
Corner Café—Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: Yes, Gluten-Free: Yes
Mama’s Fine Italian—Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: No
The Chef’s Kitchen—Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: Yes, Gluten-Free: Yes

gluten-free, to which then displays only the restaurants to which you may take the group.

Is anyone in your party a vegetarian? yes Enter

Is anyone in your party gluten-free? yes Enter
Here are your restaurant choices:
